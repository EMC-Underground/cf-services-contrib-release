RabbitMQ SRS for CloudFoundary

The rabbitmq_srs_* jobs package and configure RabbitMQ SRS to operate
as a CloudFoundry service.

To use them, your deployment description should contain something like
the following.  Note that:

- Only rabbitmq_srs_service needs to have a fixed IP, which should be
  repeated as the rabbitmq_srs.backbone_address property.

- rabbitmq_srs_service and rabbitmq_srs_node need persistent disk.
