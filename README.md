## Cloud Foundry Services Contrib Release

This repository contains legacy services components which are not under active development. We can cannot vouch for their functionality. Feel free to try them as-is and enhance them as needed.

## BOSH Release 

The structures used to deploy these services with BOSH can be found in http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-services-contrib-release/

## OSS Contributions

The Cloud Foundry team uses GitHub and accepts contributions via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

Follow these steps to make a contribution to any of our open source repositories:

1. Complete our CLA Agreement for [individuals](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/individualcontribution.pdf) or [corporations](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/corpcontribution.pdf)
1. Set your name and email

  	git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
		git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

1. Fork the repo

1. Make your changes on a topic branch, commit, and push to github and open a pull request.

Your pull request is much more likely to be accepted if:

- It is small and focused with a clear commit message that conveys the intent behind your change.

- The tests pass in CI (we use Travis CI for many of our components in large part because of their excellent support for pull requests).

- Your pull request includes tests.

We review pull requests regularly.
